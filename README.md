# Four Consonants in a Row
I just found the phrase "four consonants in a row" in a video making fun of the English language ("asthma") in this case.
The title has nothing to do with the code, but I thought it was a fun title.

## Actual description
This is a simple Reflex app that takes in a words and tries to find its representation in terms of elements of the periodic table. At the time of writing, I don't even know if this is possible for all words, but it is a fun exercise to try and find the elements that can be used to represent a word.

For example, the word "hello" can be represented as "He-Li-O", where "He" is Helium, "Li" is Lithium, and "O" is Oxygen. "Science" can be represented as "Si-Ce-N-Ce", where "Si" is Silicon, "Ce" is Cerium, and "N" is Nitrogen.
